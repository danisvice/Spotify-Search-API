# Spotify Search API Integration ðŸŽµ

Welcome to the Spotify Search API integration! This guide will walk you through the steps to seamlessly incorporate Spotify's music search functionality into your project. ðŸš€

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-search-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spotify-search-api
   ```

3. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

Using the Spotify Search API is a breeze. With just a single command, you can search for your favorite music tracks. Simply run the following command, replacing `[search query]` with your actual query and `[Spotify auth token]` with your valid Spotify authentication token:

```bash
cargo run "[search query]" "[Spotify auth token]"
```

## How to Obtain a Spotify Auth Token

To access the Spotify API, you'll need an authentication token. Follow these steps to acquire one:

1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new application.

2. Once your application is created, you'll find your client ID and client secret.

3. Use these credentials to authenticate and retrieve your access token using the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. You can find more details in the [Spotify Web API Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/).

## Example

Here's a quick example of how you can use the Spotify Search API integration in your Rust code:

```rust
use spotify_search_api::search;

fn main() {
    let search_query = "summer vibes";
    let auth_token = "your-spotify-auth-token";

    let results = search(search_query, auth_token);

    // Process and enjoy the search results!
}
```
